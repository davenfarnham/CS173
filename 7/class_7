- Core 3: uses goto statements for function calls; no way to get back to the calling function
	- leave you to manage the stack

- Ask Prof. Reiss: tail calls

		fun f () = g(5);

		fun g(x) = x + 2;

		g should just return to the return address of f:

		(g -> end) instead of (g -> f -> end) since nothing more
		is done in the fun f.


- Core 1 is normal

- Core 2 is like Cobalt; preallocate one frame per procedure - you can't recur
