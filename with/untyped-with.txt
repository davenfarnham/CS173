Part 2: Untyped is, much like last week, not possible. Think about this case:

((lam x (with x @)) (if ... (record (a 1)) (record (b 2))))

where “…” is some boolean expression. Without some kind of type annotation on 
“with” it’s not possible to know what this should return. If you started 
evaluating things it would be different, but this is not possible to do 
statically.
