- normal OO behavior:

	- subtyping

		- (1) check to see how casting works. For example, given an object {P} and an object {A} that 
		      extends {P}, given a method that expects a {P}, can I cast it to an {A} and then call a field
		      in {A}? Does this check statically? What about at runtime? (Nov 18th)					(no static type)

		- (2) Check to see that the selector in the field table gives priority to cast over instantiation type. 	(you can't really cast objects)

		- (3) Check to see that method is determined by instantiation and not static type				(no static type)

		- (4) contravariance vs covariance vs invariance (15)								(doesn't apply)

	- check and see if python exhibits the 'expression problem'								(can't really do the same - not byte code)

	- you can use isinstance(): gets rid of casting; does this work? You wouldn't be able to statically type check  	(TODO in talk about static)
	  this.

- unconventional behavior:

	- multiple inheritance: test that definitions are depth-first vs. breadth-first						(COMPLETED)
		- will something in the second class, with the same name, over write something from the first class?

	- try deleting an attribute, as mentioned in the manual, then pass that object to a method that expects the object 	(COMPLETED)
	  to have certain fields (the one you deleted)

	- scope:

		- there are different levels: inner, middle, outer
			- all variables not in the innermost scope are read only, meaning if you try to write to them
			  you'll create a new local variable in scope.
			- class definitions place another variable in the local scope

		- (1) create a function with a local variable, then a class. Reference the function's local variable
		      within the class. It should create a read-only s.t. outside the class, the function's local variable
		      shouldn't be changed even if you tried to change it in the class.

		      Now, create a variable of the same name in the class; this should save changes in state.

			- deals with mutability

	- __init__: a function that is called immediately when an object is created; can I get weird behavior from this?	(PASS)

	- difference between method objects and function objects?
		- every method object gets automatically passed a pointer to its object; the argument list is therefore always + 1
		  whatever you actually pass the method

	- you can create structs and then pass them into functions that expect objects? This seems bad.
		- 9.7

	- can I take an object, then add instance variables to it like I can do with structs above? Does this mean I'm 		(COMPLETED)
	  effectively creating a subtype of the original object? Can I still change its class variables?

- static type system:

	- what are the motivations behind a static type system vs. runtime errors?

	- he talked a bit about scripting languages that can basically accept unions of types. So, for example,
	  a Num | Object, etc. See if python can handle these kind of type ambiguities where essentially you have
	  if conditionals control the flow of the program preventing runtime type errors.
