- new construct: [conditionals]

  - conditional w/ 0 or number != 0

	- if (0) {
            5
	  }
	  else {
            6
	  }

		- Core 1 produces an error; expects a boolean. So apparently
		  Core 1 doesn't represent true and false with numbers like
		  0 and 1.

		- Core 2 returns 6; correctly evaluates 0 to false

		- Core 3 returns 5; 0 is not treated as false
