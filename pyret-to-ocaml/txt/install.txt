- to install pyret to the command line:

	1) make sure you've downloaded node and npm. To check the version of each of these:

		npm --version
		node --version

	2) one key thing I did was install node globally so that it isn't local to a particular
	   directory. to do this, run 

		'npm install npm@latest -g'

	3) download the github repo for pyret-lang

	  when I tried to make and run pyret programs, it'll sometimes throw errors. In this case, 
	  simply download the required packages globally:

		'npm install [package] -g'

	4) once everything is installed, you can compile with this:

		node build/phaseA/pyret.jarr \
		--build-runnable [infile.arr] \
		--outfile [outfile.js] \
		--builtin-js-dir src/js/trove/ \
		--builtin-arr-dir src/arr/trove \
		--require-config src/scripts/standalone-configA.json

	  and run with:

		node [name of program]

- good guide on $PATH variable:

	- temporarily add this to the path: PATH=$(pwd)/bin:$PATH

- to install bucklescript:

	** useful: https://github.com/bloomberg/bucklescript/wiki/Create-a-simple-example-with-NPM **

	1) echo "{}" > package.json

	2) echo 'let _ = Js.log "hello bucklescript!"' > hello.ml

	3) /usr/local/lib/node_modules/bs-platform/bin/bsc.exe -I /usr/local/lib/node_modules/bs-platform/ -c hello.ml

	4) node hello.js
