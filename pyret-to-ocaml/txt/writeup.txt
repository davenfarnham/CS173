Design:

	Control Flow:

		(1) parse program into s-expressions with p2a(). 		(linear in the size of the program, 'n')
		(2) filter the list of statements for functions.		(linear in the size of the list, 'm')
		(3) create records of expressions.				(linear in # of functions, 'p')
		(4) call compile-exprs.						(linear in the size of the list, 'm')

		compile-exprs -> compile-stmts -> compile-expr


	For Functions:

		(1) find all applications in the function's stmts		(linear in size of body-stmts, 'b')
		(2)

	For Numbers:

		(1) change everything to a float

Optimizations:

	So far, it looks like hits to performance could come in the main compile() function and the functions to compile functions:

				pyret-to-racket					pyret-to-ocaml
		compile(): 	      O(m)					O(2m + n + p)

		s-fun:
