	- started: 

		(1) added a new prologue including "Core.Std"
		(2) added support for:

			(2.1) s-id
			(2.2) s-num

				- if num is not an integer, add decimals for float support

			(2.3) s-bool
			(2-4) s.str

	- functions:

		- the way he seems to be doing it is he filters out the stmts of the body
		  s.t. he compiles 'lets' and 'vars' first - do placement of 'vars' and 'lets'
		  not matter in the sequence of statments?

	- completed:

		- added ";;" to statements

			- 'p2a(p).block.stmts' returns a list of statements. Take this list, add semicolons
			  in between the stmts, then call compile-expr(e)

	- todo:

		(2) switch order of function compilation; check_1.ml

		(3) functions that take no arguments, give them unit parameter ()

Questions:

	- In show(), why do you need "" in the block near the end of the function?

Possible Optimizations:

	- I go through the list of statements adding ";;" in between them, I then traverse the same list
	  calling compile-expr(e). Can I combine these two: insert-semi() and compile-expr() s.t. it only
	  traverses the statement list once instead of twice?
